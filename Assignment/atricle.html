<p>The recent collapse of CBEX has left many Nigerians and Kenyans reeling ,emotionally, mentally, and financially. It’s more than just numbers on a screen. It’s months, even years, of sweat, sacrifice, and savings… gone in an instant.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, know this first: You are not alone.And more importantly: Your life is worth far more than any amount of money lost.</p>
<h1>1. Your Pain Is Real — And Valid</h1>
<p>It’s okay to feel angry. It’s okay to cry. It’s okay to feel betrayed. But what’s not okay is believing that this is the end. It is not. Some people have lost millions. Some, their entire savings. Some are facing shame, family pressure, or even mental breakdowns. But let this truth sink in</p>
<P>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, talk to someone. A trusted friend. A pastor. A therapist. Don’t suffer in silence. Don’t isolate yourself. Speak up before it gets too heavy.</P>
<h1>2. Avoid Panic Decisions</h1>
<p>In the aftermath of trauma, we often make rash choices. Resist that urge.Here’s what you should do instead: Document everything: Save receipts, screenshots, messages — these may help with investigations. Report to authorities: The EFCC and SEC are investigating the case. Add your voice.</p>
<h1>3. The Harsh Ripple Effect: Be Security Conscious</h1>
<p>History has taught us that when large-scale scams like this happen, the streets feel it too.People become desperate. And in desperation, some turn to crime. That means:Kidnapping, armed robbery, and scams may increase in the coming months.Don’t flaunt wealth, especially online. Even if you weren't affected by CBEX, tread wisely. Secure your home and movement. Lock doors. Avoid late-night travel. Be unpredictable in your routes. Stay alert.</p>
<h1>4. Moving Forward, Smarter</h1>
<p>There is life after CBEX. It might not feel like it now, but there is.

    Here’s how to begin again:
    
     
    
    Diversify. Never put all your money in one place again.
    
     
    
    Ignore “too good to be true” promises. If it looks like magic, it’s probably manipulation.
    
     
    
    Invest in what you understand. If you don’t understand it, don’t put your money there.
    
     
    
    Use only platforms registered with the SEC or CBN. Ask questions. Do your homework.</p>\

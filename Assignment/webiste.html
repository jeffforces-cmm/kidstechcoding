<p>Stepping into a tech event always feels like opening a new chapter one filled with learning, possibilities, and new perspective.<br> While I’ve attended tech events before, this one felt different. The Lagos Startup Expo 2.0, hosted by Techpoint Africa, wasn’t just another gathering,<br> it was a meaningful experience that reminded me why I do what I do.</p>
<p>As someone who works at the intersection of tech, education, and community development, especially through my work with <b>Eclariage Africa</b>,<br> a nonprofit organization supporting underprivileged populations being in a space that celebrates innovation was deeply refreshing.</p>
<b>I stepped out for growth and I’m so glad I did!</b>
<p>Attending the <b>Lagos Startup Expo 2.0</b>, Africa’s biggest tech gathering hosted by <b>Techpoint Africa</b>, was more than just an event it was an experience.<br>From connecting with brilliant minds to discovering forward-thinking innovations, every moment reminded me why <b>showing up matters</b>.<br> It’s not just about networking; it’s about learning, sharing, and being part of the movement that's shaping the future of tech in Africa.</p>
<h1><b>The Buzz of Innovation</b></h1>
<P>The venue buzzed with energy: developers, entrepreneurs, product designers, data scientists, and curious learners all mingling in hallways, swapping ideas<br> between keynote sessions and breakout workshops. </P>
<p>Whether you were there to pitch a startup idea, explore emerging tech like AI and blockchain, or simply absorb the atmosphere it was impossible not to be inspired.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker kicked off with a powerful message about technology being a tool to shape the future not just for convenience, but for impact. It struck a chord.<br> Too often, we get caught up in the "how" of building tech and forget to ask "why."<br> That moment reminded me that the real power of technology lies in how it solves problems and connects people.</p>
<h1><b>Learning, Unlearning, and Growing</b></h1>
<p>The breakout sessions were equally insightful. One particularly impactful session focused on scaling startups in low-resource settings,<br> which gave me new ideas I’m now considering integrating into Eclariage Africa’s digital entrepreneurship training for underserved youth.<br> I was especially moved by conversations around inclusive access to digital tools and affordable innovation,<br> two challenges we face head-on in our grassroots programs.Just listening to startup founders who began from humble beginnings<br> but now serve thousands was a masterclass in perseverance and vision.</p>
